Assembly language is a low-level programming language characterized by a direct correspondence between its instructions and machine code instructions specific to a particular hardware architecture. It is inherently platform-dependent, meaning that assembly code written for one platform may not be compatible with another due to differences in hardware architectures and instruction sets.
